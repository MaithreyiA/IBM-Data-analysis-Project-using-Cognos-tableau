# IBM Data Analysis Project using Cognos and Tableau
For a course in IBM, I did a Data Analytics for the topic:
**Empowering The Future: A Literacy Rate Analysis For A Better Future Tomorrow**
Literacy is another proper indicator of economic development. For purpose of census, a person in age limit of seven and above, who can both write and read with understanding in any of the language is considered as a literate in India. Literacy plays a major role in the economic development of a nation. Although India has raised its current literacy rate of 74.04% (2021) from 12% at the time of Independence in 1947, its still lag behind the world average literacy rate of 84%. Compared with other nations, Republic of India has the largest illiterate population.

**Note:** This website has dashboard, story and report that doesn't load. it is because I am feeding Internal data from Cognos analytics.
